This is a betting bot I developed 100% in Python.  

Unlike many projects in this category, this one was truly designed with the goal of generating real profit for both clients and myself
by placing the described bets. It is not just an educational or illustrative botâ€”the real objective is to make a profit through betting. However,
it will not be possible to replicate this bot on your own server or machine, as it uses APIs containing sensitive data that I cannot share.  
This project serves to demonstrate the feasibility of such a tool, as well as my ability to successfully develop it.  


Its functions are:  
1. Receive existing data;  
2. Structure features;  
3. Train a machine learning model;  
4. Make predictions on live matches;  
5. Send EV+ betting suggestions on Telegram;  
6. Store data from matches it bet on or not;  
7. Receive results of matches where predictions were made;  
8. Update the database with betting and match results;  
9. Edit messages on Telegram with betting results;  
10. Send detailed reports every 24 hours on the model's overall betting performance.
